The Offline NT Password & Registry Editor

(c) 1997-2011 Petter Nordahl-Hagen

This file is meant for developers.

General usage is via the provided boot CD images, but
static linux builds of the tools are also available
in the source zip file.

See REAMDE for general instructions and license info,
HISTORY.txt for version info.

If you want to build yourself, it should compile
with most gcc compilers. However, I am not particulary good
with types, so there may be some warnings.

You may have to install the openssl-devel package from you
linux distro to compile/link, since I need the static variant.
(change the makefile to link dynamic if you wish)
I link statically with libcrypto.a from OpenSSL.
(chntpw only, other tools does not require crypto)

Thanks to Denis Ducamp for modifying chntpw to use OpenSSL.

Thanks to Mike Doty, via Alon Bar-Lev for 64 bit build compatible patch.
 (from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185411)

Look into Makefile, you may need to change things to fit your env.
(also if you need 64 bit)

If make goes well, you should have:
 chntpw - Password tool, dynamic with libc, static with OpenSSL
 chntpw.static - Completely static passord tool
 reged - Registry edit tool, dynamic linked with libc. No crypto.
 reged.static - Registry too, statically linked.
 cpnt - Simple copy utility, does not truncate file on write
        Now deprecated, was at least needed earlier for NTFS writes.

Also, the floppies and CDs are build under a different
environment for small libc size (uClibc), see website
for details. (build scripts not currently available..)

So, note that the binary then contains cryptographic code
which may be illegal for you to export.

Good luck.
